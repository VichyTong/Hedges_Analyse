Toni Nieminen is the youngest male Winter Olympic gold medalist, winning at 16 years and 259 days old, which beat the previous record holder by one day.

According to the Olympics, "there is no specific age limit for taking part in the Olympic Games." Instead, the minimum age for eligibility depends on each individual international sports federation and the rules it sets for its sport.

For instance, in order for gymnasts to be eligible for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, their birthday must have been before Jan. 1, 2005, according to the 1997 regulation outlining the minimum age of 16 years old to compete in senior-level events.

Meanwhile, in June of 2022, figure skating increased its minimum age for senior competition eligibility from 15 to 17 years old by the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. The International Skating Union said in a news release the change is intended to protect "the physical and mental health, and emotional well-being of the Skaters."

In the end, age of eligibility depends on what sport the athlete wishes to compete in and the specific regulations the federation has laid out.
