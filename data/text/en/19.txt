The 18-year-old Gu, affectionately called the "Snow Princess" by Chinese fans, had a whirlwind experience in Beijing. She won gold in the freeski halfpipe and became the first athlete to reach the podium in three different freestyle skiing events. She also won gold in big air and the silver medal in slopestyle.

Gu also became the poster child of the difficulties navigating two cultures.

The San Francisco-born athlete, who was born to a Chinese mother and American father, chose to represent China for the Olympics. Gu spoke frequently about spending summers in China to visit family and friends and about being fluent in both the culture and Mandarin.

"Both experiences in the two countries made me who I am. I am American when I am in America, and I am Chinese when I am in China," she said.

Questions over whether she gave up her American citizenship in order to do this arose during the Games, but Gu was mum about whether that was the case.

Critics in the U.S. accused Gu of being a "traitor" to the U.S. or said she needed to "pick a side. "

With maturity and a clear sense of self, she responded: "It doesn't really matter if other people are happy or not because I feel as though I am doing my best, I'm enjoying the entire process, and I'm using my voice to create as much positive change as I can for the voices who will listen to me in an area that is personal and relevant to myself."

China has made no qualms about embracing their "princess." Gu's appearance on Chinese TV and for ads for sports apparel and other products was constant, and it's likely we will continue to see the breakout star's face for a long time.

Gu said she plans to use her platform for good.

"I especially want to use the sport as a force to connect people in the two countries instead of dividing them," she told the media in Beijing.
