Katie Taylor worries loss of Olympic boxing would be 'huge blow' to the sport

LONDON (AP) — Katie Taylor had Olympic dreams long before she became one of the faces of women's professional boxing.
The Irish fighter won a gold medal at the 2012 London Games, setting her on course for a hugely successful pro career.
She's worried that future generations won't get the same chance because of a long-running dispute between Olympic officials and the International Boxing Association. The International Olympic Committee has declined to confirm boxing’s place in the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
“It will be a huge blow to boxing overall, even professional boxing,” Taylor told The Associated Press ahead of her fight against Chantelle Cameron in Dublin on Saturday. “The biggest incentive for amateur boxers is the Olympics. If they (don't) have that, I think it might put a lot of people off the sport. It could be a big blow for the sport as a whole really.”
The impact on women’s boxing could be particularly damaging considering it only made its Olympic debut in 2012.
Taylor and Claressa Shields have used their Olympic success as a springboard into the pro ranks — headlining cards, selling out big arenas and garnering more media attention to help push the women's game into the mainstream.

“I hope they can sort out their issues because the Olympics is a huge part of boxing,” said Taylor, the undefeated and undisputed lightweight champion who will challenge for Cameron’s super-lightweight belts on Saturday.
