The 2024 Paris Olympics isn't in question — the IOC plans to run the qualifying and final tournaments like its boxing task force did for the Tokyo Games in 2021.

The IOC cut ties with the sport’s governing body in 2019 because of concerns about governance and fair judging. It also has distrust about the IBA's ties to Russia.

An investigation found that some bouts at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics were fixed by “complicit and compliant” referees and judges. In Rio, Ireland's Michael Conlan accused Russia and the sports governing body of corruption after his bantamweight quarterfinal loss to Vladimir Nikitin.

In recent weeks, boxing officials in the United States and Britain announced plans to preserve the sport’s place at the Olympics by launching a new federation to rival the IBA, formerly known as AIBA.

Boxing has been part of every Olympic program but one since 1904, and the IOC has said it still could be added for 2028. Roland Garros, the home of the French Open, is one of the main venues for boxing at next year's Paris Games.

Boxing is Ireland's most-successful Olympic sport. Eighteen of the country's 35 medals are in boxing.

In Tokyo, Kellie Anne Harrington became only the second female Irish boxer to win an Olympic medal when she took gold in the lightweight division — like Taylor did earlier.

“Ever since I was a kid, my dream was to win an Olympic gold medal. That’s all I dreamt of," the 36-year-old Taylor said. "It’s quite sad that if it does go out ... kids are going to grow up without that dream.”
